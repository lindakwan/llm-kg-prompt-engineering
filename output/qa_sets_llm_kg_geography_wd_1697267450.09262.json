This is because the Alps are located in a direction that is perpendicular to the prevailing winds, which leads to the development of high mountain ranges in the east and the south. The north has also been developed in a similar way, with high mountain ranges forming the eastern and southern portions of the country while the north is mostly covered by the Alps.",
