The term has since been used more broadly to describe any city that is significantly larger than the surrounding area, regardless of population density.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why a city might become a primate city. A city may be the capital of a country, or it may be a major hub for trade or transportation. Additionally, a city may simply have a much higher population density than the surrounding area due to a variety of factors, such as a strong economy or a desirable location.\n\nNot all cities that are significantly larger than the surrounding area are considered primate cities. For a city to be considered a primate city, it must also have more than double the national average population. Additionally, the term is typically only used to describe cities within a single country.\n\nThere are a number of disadvantages that can come with being a primate city. A city's disproportionate size can lead to a number of problems, such as overcrowding, crime, and pollution. Additionally, a primate city can be difficult to govern effectively due to its large size and complex social structure.",
