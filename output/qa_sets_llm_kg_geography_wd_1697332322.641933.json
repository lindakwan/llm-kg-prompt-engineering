Each of these districts would have a strong economic and social center that would draw in other districts to the city. This would create a virtuous circle of growth, which would create more jobs and more businesses, which would create more jobs and more businesses, and so on.\n\nMoses's theory has been met with criticism, as it does not take into account the fact that cities can also grow inward.
