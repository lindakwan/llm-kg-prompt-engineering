This trend has continued in the past decade, with more and more states moving their primaries up in an effort to gain more influence in the selection of the presidential nominees. This has resulted in a compressed primary season, with many states holding their primaries in the first few months of the year. This has allowed candidates to gain momentum early in the process, and has made it more difficult for late entrants to gain traction. It has also made it more difficult for candidates to campaign in all of the states, as they must focus their efforts on the early states in order to gain an advantage.",

In the case of Mapp v. Ohio (1961), the Supreme Court held that the exclusionary rule, which prevents illegally obtained evidence from being used in court, applies to state law. The Court reasoned that the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause requires states to provide the same level of protection against unreasonable searches and seizures as the Fourth Amendment does.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination to state law. In the case of Malloy v. Hogan (1964), the Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination applies to state law. The Court reasoned that the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause requires states to provide the same level of protection against self-incrimination as the Fifth Amendment does.",
