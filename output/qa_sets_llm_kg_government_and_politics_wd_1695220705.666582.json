This trend has continued in the past decade, with more and more states moving their primaries up in an effort to gain more influence in the selection of the presidential nominees. This has resulted in a compressed primary season, with many states holding their primaries in the first few months of the year. This has allowed candidates to gain momentum early in the process, and has made it more difficult for late entrants to gain traction. It has also made it more difficult for candidates to campaign in all of the states, as they must focus their efforts on the early states in order to gain an advantage.",
