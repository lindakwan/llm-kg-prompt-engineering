It also requires certain jurisdictions with a history of discrimination in voting to obtain pre-clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice before implementing any changes to their voting laws or practices.

        "new_response": "Answer: There are a few potential reasons why network news coverage has become less diverse in recent years. One possible explanation is the increasing consolidation of media ownership, which has resulted in fewer independent news outlets and a decrease in the variety of perspectives presented in news coverage. Additionally, the rise of digital media has led to a shift in focus away from traditional news outlets, resulting in fewer resources devoted to covering diverse topics. Finally, the prevalence of \u201cclickbait\u201d headlines and sensationalized stories has led to a decrease in the quality of news coverage, which may have contributed to a decrease in diversity.",

While some labor unions may be more progressive and support more left-leaning policies, others may be more conservative and support more right-leaning policies. This ideological divide has made it difficult to create a unified labor party that could represent the interests of all workers.\n\nFinally, the United States has a two-party system, which makes it difficult for a third party to gain traction.
