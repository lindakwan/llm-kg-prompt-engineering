In the preconditions for take-off stage, the economy begins to diversify and modernize, with increased investment in infrastructure and technology. The take-off stage is marked by rapid economic growth and industrialization. The drive to maturity stage is characterized by further economic diversification and increased productivity.

For example, if a business spends $1,000 on new equipment, that money is then used to pay the supplier, who in turn pays its employees, who then spend their wages on goods and services, and so on.

The core is the oldest and most densely populated area, while the outer circles are newer and less densely populated. Burgess identified five concentric zones: the central business district, the transition zone, the working-class zone, the middle-class zone, and the commuter zone. The central business district is the commercial and financial center of the city, while the transition zone is a mix of residential and commercial areas. The working-class zone is the area closest to the central business district and is populated by lower-income residents. The middle-class zone is further out and is populated by middle-class residents. The commuter zone is the outermost zone and is populated by those who commute to the city for work.\n\nBurgess' theory has been widely accepted and has been used to explain the growth and development of cities. It has been used to explain the segregation of different social classes in cities, as well as the development of suburbs. The theory has also been used to explain the emergence of gentrification in cities, as well as the development of transportation networks.",
